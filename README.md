# Vampire Lib
This is a version of [Vampire](https://vprover.github.io) that has been
modified to allow it to be used as an embedded library in other applications.
Normally, Vampire is only available as a binary executable.

See the [original vampire repository](https://github.com/vprover/vampire) 
for more details.
